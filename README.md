# Top-100-Song-Covers-Dataset
A Webscraping &amp; Data Visualization project which analyzes a URL based on the Top 100 cover songs submitted for popular music.

In simplest terms, I've used the BeautifulSoup4 Library in Python to pull website data from a Top 100 Cover Songs website. Then, I proceeded to do a bit of data analysis and visualization to identify the Musical Artist's that have received the most submissions!
